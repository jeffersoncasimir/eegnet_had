EEGManyLabs - Resting State Dataset - HajcakHolroyd2005
=====================================================
This dataset contains raw EEG resting-state recordings (eyes open, eyes closed) in BIDS format.
These data have been collected as part of an EEGManyLabs replication (study ID in heading),
prior to the main replication task. Participants are healthy adults.

BE AWARE - EEG data from multiple different sites.
Recordings have different sampling rates, channel layouts, recording references,
and have not been rereferenced.
Data were cropped, trigger codes harmonized, acq_date changed for deidentification,
and recordings were exported as EDF format.
